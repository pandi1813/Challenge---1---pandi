## Check out the live webpage [here](https://pandi1813.github.io/Challenge-1---pandi/)
## Goal

To improve the given code to make the webpage more accessible, the code cleaner, and easier to read.


## HTML improvements
* Changed the non-semantic 'div' elements to semantic 'header', 'main' and 'footer' elements.
* Changed the 'title' in the 'head' element to a more descriptive one to make it easier for search engines to find the webpage.
* Fixed the link that wasn't working in the navigation bar,
* Made the code easier to read by adding extra empty lines between main divisions.
* added 'alt' attribute to images and icons.
* Changed the last headinh to 'h4' so they follow sequential order.

## CSS improvements
* Fixed class and element selectors they target the correct HTML elements.
* Rearranged selectors and properties to follow the HTML structure.
* Consolidated CSS by selecting elements with the same rules together instead of separately.
* Added comments to make it easier to navigate through the stylesheet in future works
